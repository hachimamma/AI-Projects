# FarmerAI

Not gonna sugercoat it- This thing was probably one of the best things I had created and I kinda like this one and I wasn't lazy at all. In sum total, this is a simple AI project on recognizing an classifying diseases of plants based on the structure and study of their leaves and their features using a vast dataset of 3 Gigs but then, this again needed to be synthesized and again put into use in the ML algorithm and then portrayed on the website created for the display and then, it also suggest cure for the diseases detected based on a dataset created by Ousnik. I am the dumb person here since I was the one creating the core AI codes and I kinda messed up at the main loss part, and it went negative so, I would say it requires further fine tuning so, it would really matter to me if anyone could reach out and point it out ot me please!

Anyways, enjoy the content and follow if it was useful!

Cheers, fellow coders!
